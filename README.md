* List your project's repo in the [issue you create](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/projects/issues/new) [on this board](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/projects#boards).
* List the proposal in an easy to read format following the structure bellow

After creating your proposal repo, you can use ZenHub to collaborate via GitHub. It is an easy way organize a distributed team with the people scattered across the world working on making your idea happen. You can think of these boards as a place where **users and team members can interact** via the issue system embedded in GitHub, **on the specific topic of the repo**.

## Proposal structure

Go to the [ZenHub Projects board](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/projects#boards) to get an overview of the projects currently in progress or [create straight away a new issue](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/Projects/issues/new) , containing the name of your proposal.

*The proposals should be descriptive and contain the following elements:*
- [ ] Why this idea?
- [ ] How does this idea adds to the ethereum ecosystem?
- [ ] Who benefits from this idea?
- [ ] Proposal members
- [ ] Roadmap
- [ ] Budget
- [ ] People & skills needed
- [ ] Sustainability (monetization, business model if any, etc)

## Share the knowledge!

Through https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/documentation you can coordinate blogposts, hangouts, screencasts and tutorials. Open source is also about people creating connections with the projects they care about. Make it easy for people to find yours and see why it's great!
