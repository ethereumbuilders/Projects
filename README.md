Dapp Proposals
=========
## Each Dapp should have its own repo

* List your proposal's repo in the issue you create on this board https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/proposals#boards.
* List the proposal in an easy to read format following the structure bellow

## Proposal structure

Go to https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/proposals#boards and create an issue in the "new" column with the name of your proposal.

*The proposals should be descriptive and contain the following elements:*
- [ ] Why this idea?
- [ ] How does this idea adds to the ethereum ecosystem?
- [ ] Who benefits from this idea?
- [ ] Proposal members
- [ ] Roadmap
- [ ] Budget
- [ ] People & skills needed
- [ ] Sustainability (monetization, business model if any, etc)

## Finances  

It is preferable to use a multisig enabled wallet, like https://copay.io/ 

List an address, prefferably a multisig address that is shared among at least 3 members with a 2 out of 3 policy. A wallet that functions pretty well 

It is recommended that after each approval/spending round, to list or post a screenshot in the comments thread of the board issue containing the tranzaction(s). 

## GitHub team governance model

When structuring your proposal repo, make sure to include these repos. 

- [ ] governance
- [ ] feedback
- [ ] community
- [ ] ideas
- [ ] whatever other are your project has from media outreach to business dev

Use them to keep in touch with the people working on the idea, making it a success. Via zemhub, create boards fitting your needs. Think that these boards will be the place where users and team members can interact versus the issue system embedded in GitHub, on the specific topic of the repo.

## Share the knowledge!

Through https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/education you can coordinate blogposts, hangouts, screencasts and tutorials. Open source is also about people creating connections with the projects they care about. Make it easy for people to find yours and see why it's great!
